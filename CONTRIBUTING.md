# Steps

1. Fork repository

2. Make changes

   If you don't know Python:

   ​	Edit internships.csv (No need to worry about ordering since we would sort jobs via a script)

   Else:

   ​    Create a Python virtual environment and install the needed Python packages with 

   ​    <u>pip install -r requirements.txt</u>

3. Open a pull request!

   

   If you find the process above difficult, just make an issue in GitHub, and we would take a look.
